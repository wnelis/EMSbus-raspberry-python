# EMSbus-raspberry-python

A number of boiler brands, for instance Nefit and Buderus, use a two-wire connection for communication between the various devices in the heating system, the EMS-bus. EMS stands for "Energy Management System". The intention of this project is to monitor the status and the performance of devices attached to the EMS-bus, typically a boiler and a thermostat, and to have the ability to control the heating system via EMS-bus as well. The modular setup should allow one to make an interface to for instance domoticz. This project is designed to utilize a Raspberry Pi, running raspbian, and is programmed in Python3.
